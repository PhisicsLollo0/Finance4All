Finance4All is a Python-based toolkit for analyzing, backtesting, and visualizing financial portfolios. It provides tools for scraping historical price data, computing portfolio returns, evaluating risk metrics, and generating insightful plots.

## 🔗 Live Demo

Try the interactive Streamlit app here: [finance4all.streamlit.app](https://finance4all.streamlit.app/)

The app provides a simple interface to explore portfolio analytics:

- **Home:** Overview of the project, purpose, and key features. A starting point to understand what Finance4All offers.
- **Rolling Returns:** Interactive visualization of rolling return metrics across portfolios. Select different portfolios, time windows, and periods to explore return trends over time.

## Features

- **Data Scraping:** Download and update historical price data for various assets.
- **Portfolio Analysis:** Load, prune, and analyze custom portfolios.
- **Return Computation:** Calculate annualized and rolling returns for different time windows.
- **Risk Metrics:** Compute geometric means, quantiles, and maximum drawdown.
- **Visualization:** Plot returns distributions, rolling returns, and drawdown charts.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Finance4All
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the main notebook:**
   Open `prices_scraping.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and execute the cells to scrape data, compute returns, and generate plots.

## Example Usage

```python
from src.scraping.get_data import *
from src.portfolio.data_manipulation import *
from src.computations.compute_returns import *

# Download and load data
get_data_info()
data = get_data_updated_2025()

# Analyze portfolios
portfolios = ['100_2factors', '80_20_2factors', ...]
for portfolio_name in portfolios:
    portfolio = load_portfolio(portfolio_name)
    data, weights = prune_data_portfolio(portfolio)
    results = compute_portfolio_returns_combined(data, weights, years=10)
```

## Notebooks

- **prices_scraping.ipynb:** Main workflow for scraping, analysis, and plotting.
- Additional notebooks in `notebooks/` for in-depth exploration.
